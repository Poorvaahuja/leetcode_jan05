LEETCODE PROBLEMS
## Q1
There is an m x n binary grid matrix with all the values set 0 initially. Design an algorithm to randomly pick an index (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1. All the indices (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 should be equally likely to be returned.
Optimize your algorithm to minimize the number of calls made to the built-in random function of your language and optimize the time and space complexity.
Implement the Solution class:
Solution(int m, int n) Initializes the object with the size of the binary matrix m and n.
int[] flip() Returns a random index [i, j] of the matrix where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1.
void reset() Resets all the values of the matrix to be 0.
## Q2
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence
Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 2500
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
