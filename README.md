LEETCODE PROBLEMS
## Q1
There is an m x n binary grid matrix with all the values set 0 initially. Design an algorithm to randomly pick an index (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1. All the indices (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 should be equally likely to be returned.
Optimize your algorithm to minimize the number of calls made to the built-in random function of your language and optimize the time and space complexity.
Implement the Solution class:
Solution(int m, int n) Initializes the object with the size of the binary matrix m and n.
int[] flip() Returns a random index [i, j] of the matrix where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1.
void reset() Resets all the values of the matrix to be 0.
## Q2
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence
Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 2500
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
## Q3
Given a binary tree root, return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).
Assume a BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
## Q4
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
